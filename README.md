# RabbitMQ - Docker

***Disclaimer***: This is just an example of a RabbitMQ server with SSL enabled on a Docker machine. You may wish to modify **rabbitmq_files/rabbitmq-definitions.json**, **rabbitmq.config** with your own credentials and **certificates** with your own certificates.

**Run**: *./docker-start.sh*

This script will build your Docker image based on the current Dockerfile and run it in a detached mode with default ports exposed.
